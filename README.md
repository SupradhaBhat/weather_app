# weather_app
A web application that uses an API from openweathermap.org to display the weather details of a particular city entered.

This project is about building a web application to show a weather forecast using weather API, the api providers are
- https://openweathermap.org/
- https://www.weatherapi.com/

The front-end is simple and made with HTML and CSS.The backend uses JS which gets takes the city name from search query and requests weather details using an API from openweathermap.org. Details like temperature, max temperature, min temperature, humidity, wind speed are displayed to the user.Also we use another API from weatherapi.com to set the current date and time of that particular city. The background in UI is dynamically set to an image obtained by concatenating the city name with the url from source.unsplash.com.
