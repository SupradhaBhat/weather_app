The front-end is simple and made with HTML and CSS.The backend uses JS which gets takes the city name from search query and requests weather details using an API from openweathermap.org. Details like temperature, max temperature, min temperature, humidity, wind speed are displayed to the user.Also we use another API from weatherapi.com to set the current date and time of that particular city.
